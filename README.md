In recent years, data science has seen significant growth, as highlighted by the 2020 LinkedIn U.S. Emerging Jobs Report. Nearly every industry is now competing for data science professionals to help them utilize their data for informed business decisions. However, the demand for these professionals far exceeds the current supply, making the competition among companies particularly intense compared to other tech fields. Consequently, employers are offering high salaries to attract skilled data scientists.

Despite the lucrative opportunities in this field, data science salaries can vary widely. Employers consider various factors when determining compensation, such as the professional's level of experience, specific skills, job title, and the size of the company.
